                    it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or the
                    effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                    overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates

         <div type="item"><head>THE LATEST POLITICAL DISEASE.</head>
             <p>‘‘The Morning Post" says : "The latest political disease is ‘Pan-Mania’ .... Fundamen- tally, of course, the prefix ’Pan’ indicates that all the scattered parts of the race, nation, country, or religion are to be united, but very considerable variations from this ‘motif’ are permitted. . . .	Two of the greatest of
                 the ‘Pans’ overlap very seriously—Pan-Germans in Brazil and the Argentine mast be difficult to place in a Pan-American system. When we come to the second great ‘Pan’ we are on firmer ground. Pan-Germanism is not all coherent, but it has a solid foundation. The Pan-German cult expands itself in one direction to recover for Germany (not intellectually only but politically) the peoples of Teutonio stock who are not Germane (though they speak the German tongue the Swiss and Austrians, and the Low German peoples, the Dutch, Belgians (and even the Boers) while in another direction it spreads to the Colonies of Germans on German soil, and even to the small German settlements in towns and countries which are not German. Pan-Germanism has an organisation not confined to one body bot ramifying through hundreds of associations, political, economic, and even religions. They are not called Pan-Germanic societies, nor are they openly affiliated to the League which bears that name, bat-they are informed with the Pan-German spirit, helped with Pan- German foods, and (with different degrees of zeal) press for the seemed. Pan Germanism is not a political party in Germany, but a cult or ideal which can be adopted by any party. In Austria, however, the Pan-Germans actually go to the polls and sit in Parliament as such. They are at present the only ‘Pans' of any kind to do so. Pan-Slavism, in its broadest sense, as implying a league or union of the Slav peoples, is little more than an impious aspiration. The Czechs, who are the most advanced of all the Slav races, would always want to lead, and this privilege would never be accorded by any of the others. The elimination of Russia (for the time being at all events) precludes the idea of a Pan Slav union in the Near East under her august patronage and protection. Such as it is, however, Pan Slavism altogether overshadows the little Pan-Hellenic propaganda which is Greece’s latest contribution to the happiness of the world. Pan-Buddhism has a powerful propaganda to day in China, which aims at rousing the national and racial pride of the Orientals and inducing them to develop on their own lines and not on Western ones. The singular feature of Pan-Islam is that, as a name, an idea, a ‘motif to be interpreted by each man after his kind, it is at present uniting a very considerable proportion of the world's population, and, unlikely other ‘Pan,’ it has no limitation, ethnographic, geographic, or national.”

            <div type="item"><head>THE PROPOSED BANQUET.</head>
                <p>The native press, having exhausted itself in discussing the many and various problems connected with the treatment of Helbawi Bey by Prince Mohamed Aly Paras, and the alleged secret interview of Abon Shadi Bey with Mr. Findlay, has now found a fresh source of inspiration in the approaching banquet, which is to be given in honour of Kamel's return to his native land. We, however, deeply regret to notice that many of the leading journalistic luminaries of the nationalist newspaper world appear to be disposed to
                    skulk in their tents in view of the splendid ovation that is to be given to the great protagonist of Egyptian nationalism. The lesser lights of the vernacular Anglophobe press naturally feel rather out of it, for "A1 Minbar” and its brethren will suffer au eclipse when the editor of "Al Lews" returns in all his glory.
                    "Misr" is of opinion that the banquet is premature, and that it should be postponed until the English have withdrawn from Egypt and the country has obtained complete independence !
                    A journalist writes to "Al Watan" to protest against the proposed banquet. He states that the Pasha does not deserve snob an honor, at he has not rendered any services to the country, but is merely working for his own ends. The writer goes on to state that he has only distinguished himself by arousing bitterness between Moslem and Christian, and that if such a banquet be given, it will lead to a very bad impression in England.
                    The same paper publishes a telegram from Tantah to the effect that a large number of native notables there have decided to oppose the proposed scheme for honoring the Pasha.
                    An amusiug example of nationalist fervor is seen in the proposal of one of the supporters of the Pasha that the "pièce de resistance" at the forthcoming banquet should be an Egyptian camel in honor of that serviceable creature's namesake. Whether one or more of these quadrupeds is to be cooked for the occasion we do not know, bat sorely one would not be enough to go round among the many supporters of Kamel, who will flock to the banquet. The symbolic signification involved in snob a dish will probably only be divulged to the initiates, bat, on the other hand, the idea may have been merely suggested by the simple coincidence of the names. No doubt this problem will be dis- cussed ad nauscam in the columns of our contemporaries, for the bill of fare is already leading to criticism.
                    The idea of a "national" repast pare and simple has not met with universal approval, for it is recognized that if the banquet is solely confined to Egyptian dishes and drinks, the mena will hardly be to the taste of the hero of the evening, who has been accustomed in London to the gastronomic delicacies of the Carlton Hotel. The idea of an essentially 'nationalistic" bill of fare is a good one, bat it is somewhat difficult to realise. Possibly a compromise may be effected by varying the monotony with a few Jew Turkish dishes. We might venture to suggest a via media in the shape of a Pan-Islamic feast. which could thus embrace a variety of dishes, Moorish, Algerian, Tunisian, etc. Surely this would be the most simple way out of the difficulty.

A special feature of the Pasha’s English paper will be a series of articles by Little Englander Members of Parliament.

                <p>It has been implied that a transit of 29 ½  days between London and Hong Kong by the Canadian route would, if maintained, establish a permanent acceleration of seven days as compared with the transit viâ the Suez Canal. So far back as 1898 the scheduled transit for the English mail to Hong Kong from London, via Suez, was 18 ½ days—one day lees than the promised westerly transit—while delivery by the Suez route has in practice invariably been made in advance of schedule time. Moreover, while the present scheduled transit for the Suez route is 27 ½ days, the actual carriage of the mail between London and Hong-Kong is made in less than 26 days—three to four days better, it is claimed, than the new "record" claimed for the Canadian route. It will be remembered that the promoters of the Baghdad Railway have never ceased their efforts to interest Preach finance in that enterprise, and that financial influences in France have occasionally resisted the opposition made to the scheme on political grounds. These facts, the “Times" Paris correspondent says, give special interest to the attention attracted in financial circles in Paris by the discussion of the question by the Dross of Calcutta and Bombay, which contends that the Baghdad Railway will never be a very brilliant affair from a business standpoint and can never seriously damage the Suez Canal.

                <p>A Bombay Government resolution, reviewing the results of the cultivation of Egyptian cotton in Sind daring 1905, remarks that they not so promising as originally anticipated, owing partly to the unfavourable character of the season, but perhaps more largely to the very partial adoption only by the Sindhi zamindars of the Egyptian methods of cultiva- tion, which are far more expensive and laborious than the indigenous methods to which they are accustomed. Owing to the peculiar circumstances of the province it is feared that considerable time will elapse before the imperfect indigenous methods are supplanted by the Egyptian. Patience and persuasion are therefore commended to the authorities
                    There was apparently some difficulty in disposing of last year's Indian "Egyptian” crop in India only one firm purchasing it in any large quantity at fair prices ; and these were lower than the prices obtained for the sample hairs sent borne by the authorities to Liverpool.

                <p>Dear Sir,— In your issue of the 27th August, you were good enough to publish my letter to you on the subject of the Egyptian Land and General Trust. Io that letter I told the shareholders that there was no time to lose. I bad not, however, an idea that I was offering this caution with so much reason as now appears. By the time this reaches you any shareholders now in Egypt will be in possession of a notice fed London, 4th September, to the effect that a general meeting will be held here on the 14th idem. From the circumstances of the this will probably resolve itself into another unimportant London gathering to deal with important issues. At this meeting we are to be told how "the Board are now dealing with  offers which appear to be favourable for the extending the operations of the company”; of the arrangement under which "Mr. Mack is to take charge of the business of the company in Egypt," and presumably of the disappearance of Mr. Lonsdorfer from the list of directors. Many of us will, I am sure, be anxious to hear :— (a) How money, is to be found tor extending operations ? (b) What opportunities now exist comparable with those which have been the making of the "Estates," 'Delta Lands," and others ? (c) Why we are once more deprived of valuable local experience ? I am still, only more so,</p>

                <p>Dear Sir,—IN reply to the interesting letter of one of your correspondents in connection with the picture which appeared in ‘The Sphere” of Jane 16th last of British soldiers surrounding the Sphinx, I beg to inform you that while it is true that this interesting picture was published in The Sphere,'' our journal carefully guarded itself from the statement that the men actually on the Sphinx belonged to the Lancashire Position. We merely committed ourselves to the generalization that British soldier on reaching Egypt were naturally interested in the Sphinx, and that the Lancashire were specially so in view of their services in the campaign of 1801.
                    Not for worlds would one hurt the feelings of such a gallant regiment as the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, whos heroic deeds have found their most eloquent champion in Lord Mucaulay, and whose services in Egypt in 1801 are also immortalised in their colours. - </p>
                <p>I am, dear Sir, Yours truely,</p>

                <p>According to the “Sudan Times,’’ the high Nile of this year has been unprecedented in the modern history of the Sudan. Before Mahdism, however, higher Niles have been known. Sometimes we are told, the waters of the Blue Nile threatened to overflow Khartoum, that the draining of rain water by natural methods was impracticable. An artificial stratagem had to be resorted to. All water was drained into a large "birka” near the river over a dyke by a steam lifting machine.

                <p>A native notable of experience informs us that a further rise of one metre over the present levels is cemetery before the “huge" lands can be naturally irrigated. He is confident of a farther heavy rainfall in this month which will result in the realization of this occurrence.
                </p>
                <p>A heavy rainfall occurred on Monday, the 3d instant accompanied by a severe thunderstorm. The rain was typically tropical in its volume The lightning and thunder continued far into the night, the storm subsiding early on Tuesday morning.
                    The rainfall amounted to 16 millimeters
                    On the 29th of August the Nile level at Rosaires was 19.20. A rise of one metre and ninety centimeters occurred on the 1st inst. When the level readings were 21.10. This sudden rise gives reason for anxiety and we understand that the Governemnt is taking the necessary steps to protect Khartonm from its effect.

Et pois il aurait fallu noos prendre pour des naïfs et deg ignorante pour nous faire oroire qne la politiqas anglaise, qni noos a ravi 1e Bondan et les ports de U mer Ronge défendait les droits de l'Egypte à Tabah 1
                    Dire qne noos voulons voir les Tores aaltree de l'Egypte est ans absurdité. Ce que noua voulons, o’eat voir 1a question d’Egypte posée définitivement devant l’Europe Tontes les paissances ont des intérêts considérables en Egypte. Son sort ne pent donc dépendre de noos seals et après l’évaeoetion de notre territoire par Us troupes anglaises U question n'sura qu’uns seule solution : U rétablissement des droits oonférés à l’Bgypte par U traité ds Londres de 1840 et par Us firmans impériaux, en dotant U pays d'une Constitution libérals

                <p>Depuis l'aooord Ébglo-français quelques journalistes français opt era de leur devoir de mener en Egypte one campagne favorabU à l'occupation anglaise.

Plus nous avançons, pins noos comptons snr nos propres foras.

                    II est dono bien compréhensible qae nous noos sentions lésés par une politique qui noua a fait tant de msL Mais o'est une erreur de oroire que nous avoua ooblié le passé, l’histoire et tout oe que la France a fait en Egypte.
