                            understand the causes which have led to the
                            friction between the two Powers it is necessary
                            to go back to 1885, when the Egyptian
                            Government evacuated the Sudan. The precise
                            status of the territory south of Wady Haifa
                            during the period of Muhdist list dominion gave
                            rise to international questions of considerable
                            nicety. Was the suzerainty if the Sultan of
                            Turkey over the Upper Nile basin to be
                            regarded as continuing in spite of the interruption
                            of effective occupation ? Or was the 
                            abandoned territory to revert to the condition of
                            “no man’s land” where finding and conquering
                            was keeping 1 The a swers given to these
                            questions were at once inconclusive and
                            conflicting, says the "Morning Post”.</p>
                        <p>In the early Nineties the following was
                            roughly the situation. By the Anglo-German
                            Agreement of 1890 Great Britain acquired as
                            her sphere of influence territories which, in
                            addition to certain districts bordering upon
                            Victoria Nyanza and Lake Albert, virtually
                            included the old Egyptian Equatorial Province.
                            At that time, however, the effective occupation
                            of this territory was out of the question, and
                            the area under direct British control was practically
                            limited to Uganda. Meanwhile other
                            Powers were displaying an unmistakable interest
                            in the valley of the Upper Nile. The
                            forces of the Congo Free State had penetrated
                            to the banks of the river, although the
                            expedition had been forced to retire without
                            securing a permanent footing. It was also
                            becoming increasingly evident that France entertained
                            designs in the same direction. Having
                            declined to recognise the Anglo-German Agreement
                            of 1890, she apparently regarded herself
                            as being at liberty to take possession of any
                            part of the territories concerned which had not
                            been actually occupied. Under these
                            circumstances the position of the Liberal Government
                            was extremely difficult. While reluctant to
                            abandon England’s claim to the control of the
                            Upper Nile, they had to reckon with the fact
                            that the temper of the party would be resolutely
                        <cb n="4"/>
                            opposed to any expenditure of blood or money
                            for the purpose of adding to British territory and
                            British responsibilities. Placed in this dilemma
                            the Cabinet had recourse to a device which
                            at least possessed the merit of ingenuity
                            Their solution of the difficulty lay in the
                            employment of the Congo State as a means
                            of counteracting the ambitions of France.
                            Accordingly under the Anglo-Congolese Agreement
                            of May, 1894, Great Britain leased to
                            King Leopold, a considerable tract of country
                            bounded on the east by the Nile from Lake
                            Albert to Fashoda, on the north by the 10th
                            parallel of North latitude, and on the west by
                            the 25th meridian of East longitude, and on
                            the south by the Congo Nile watershed. A
                            glanoe at the map shows that the area thus
                            described includes the whole of the district
                            known as the Bahr-el-Ghazil. The terms of
                            lease were as follows : The portion of the leas
                            ed territory lying to the W. of the 80th meridian
                            of E. longitude was to be held so long as
                            tie Congo State should remain, as an independent
                            State or a Belgian Colony, under King
                            Leopold and his successors. On the other hand,
                            the lease of the portion lying to the east of the
                            same meridian was to expire on King Leopold’s
                            death. The other provisions of the agreement,
                            which were subsequently cancelled, need not
                            here be noticed. The effect of this arrangement
                            was obvious. In the first place Great Britain
                            secured from the Congo State the recognition
                            of her sphere of influence as determined by
                            the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890; secondly,
                            and most important, she interposed an apparenetly
                            insuperable obstacle between the French
                            sphere and the Nile, inasmuch as the country
                            to the north of the 10th parallel was effectively
                            barred by the Mahdists.</p>
                            <p>France, as might be expected, was not disposed
                                to take this reverse lying down. Moreover,
                                an effective means of asserting hen elf was
                                opportunely to hand. She was at the moment
                                engaged in negotiations with King Leopold
                                with reference to the frontier between the
                                French and Belgian possessions in the Congo
                                Basin. In order, therefore, to obtain a satisfactory
                                settlement of the boundary question
                                the King of the Belgians was compelled in
                                August, 1894, to enter into an agreement
                                with France by which he renounced all right
                                of occupation or influence in that part of the
                                leased territory which lay west and north
                                5 deg. 30 min. North latitude and the 30th
                                parallel of E. longitude. In other words, he
                                practically assigned to France the lease of all
                                the territory comprised in the Anglo Congolese
                                Agreement with the exception of the Lado
                                enclave.</p>
                        <p>The next chapter in the story deals with
                            those relations between France and Great Britain
                            which are centred in the Fashoda affair.
                            In regard to these events, which are still
                            fresh in the minds of most people, it is only
                            necessary to point oat that the claims put
                            forward by France on the strength of her
                            agreement with the Congo Fres State were
                            finally renounced in virtue of the Anglo-French
                            Agreement of March, 1899, by which
                            she recognised inter alia the paramount tights
                            in the Upper Nile Valley acquired by the
                            victors at Omdurman. France having thus retired,
                            the relations between the Congo Free
                            State on the one baud and Great Britain and
                            the Sudan on the other still remained to be
                            cleared up.</p>
                        <p>If the rights in the territories (outside the
                            Lado enclave), which hid been leased to King
                            Leopold under the Anglo-Congolese Agreement
                            of May, 1894, had been assigned to
                            France in August of the same year, it might
                            fairly be argued that under the Anglo-French
                            Agreement of 1899 the same rights had been
                            reassigned to Great Britain. In that case
                            the title of the latter as leaseholder would
                            have been merged in her position as freeholder.
                            If that contention has not been put forward
                            by the British Government, it may be
                            that they considered themselves to be estopped
                            by a passage in a despatch written in August,
                            1898, by the late Lord Salisbury to the British
                            Ambassador in Paris, in which, referring to
                            the Franco-Congolese Agreement of August,
                            1891, he remarks that “that concession on
                            his [t e, King Leopold’s] part did not diminish
                            the significance of the act as an assertion
                            of her rights by England.” In view of
                            his sentence it may no doubt have been
                            held that the British Government was bound
                            to regard the original lease as still continuing
                            in fall force.</p>
                        <p>Be that as it may, it is highly satisfactory
                            to learn that* the new arrangement between
                            Great Britain and the Congo State has given
                            effect to a settlement which in logic, if not
                            in right. Great Britain had every reason to
                            demand. The point of the agreement, signed,
                            last week by Sir Edward Grey and Baron
                            van Eetvelde, consists, it would seem, in
                            the cancellation of the 1894 lease, not merely
                            in respect of that part of the Bahr-el-Ghszal
                            situated to the west of the 30th meridian
                            of East longitude, but of the whole of the
                            leased area outside the Lado enclave. The
                            last-named district will presumably continue
                            to be held on lease by King Leopold until his
                            death, after which it will automatically
                            to Great Britain.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday we announced that a Greek boy,
                            thirteen years of age, had hilled himself by
                            taking poison, and that his body had been
                            found near Al Mezarita. The story of the
                            circumstances that led to his suicide is a curious
                            one, He was a pupil at the Averoff School at
                            Alexandria and fell in love with a little Greek
                            girl in the same school, twelve years of age.
                            One day he wrote a love letter to her and
                            entrusted the missive to a girl school friend of
                            his sweetheart, who very properly at once gave
                            it to her teacher. The result was that he was
                            brought up and punished and his father
                            communicated with. The parent in his turn reprimanded
                            the youthful Romeo, who was so filled
                            with remorse that he straightway put an end

                    <p>The news of the capsizing of a torpedo-boat
                        of the Mediterranean Fleet is, unhappily, 
                        confirmed. The information which is at present
                        available is as follows : Torpedo-boats Nos. 63,
                        46, 83, 47 and the Noby with No. 56, left Port
                        Said lest night, in the wake of H.M.S. Arrogant,
                        Amethyst, and Thetis, bound in the
                        direction of Malta. There was a heavy sea on
                        at the time, and while the flotilla was off
                        Damietta at about 3 o’clock this morning
                        torpedo-boat No. 56, which was being towed
                        by H.M.S. Arrogant, fouled the tow rope in
                        the storm, and capsized in thirty fathoms of
                        water. Of the crew of fifteen, seven were
                        drowned, three of the others being severely
                        injured. The torpedo boat was in command of
                        Lieut. Addison, who is among the rescued.</p>

                    <p>The “Spectator” thinks that, in view of
                        recent developments in our position in Egypt,
                        it is ridiculous that the Sultan should maintain
                        a Turkish High Commissioner in Cairo.
                        While the Imperial Commissioner, Mukhtar
                        Pasha, confined himself to the dignified
                        indolence of a great Turkish official, little
                        harm was done, and we rightly tolerated him
                        as a picturesque anachronism. As long as such
                        anachronisms are not harmful, Englishmen of
                        all kinds obey a very proper instinct in not
                        only leaving them alone, but actually admiring
                        them. When, however, anachronisms become
                        dangerous they mast be removed, and it
                        appears to us that the Turkish High Commissioner
                        has now entered upon this stage,</p>

                    <p>The natives of Cairo are beginning to take
                        far more interest in the Library, and to utilize
                        it more extensively, than heretofore. In 1904,
                        only 3,331 persons need the reading-rooms ;
                        in 1905, they were need by 13,778 persons,
                        or an average of about 40 readers a day. Of
                        these, 13.000 were Egyptians. During the
                        pilgrim season, the Library is visited by
                        numbers of Moslems from Morocco, Algeria,
                        Tunis, Turkey, and Russia. The number of
                        persons who borrowed books for home use
                        during the year was 52, of whom 37 were Europeans ;
                        1,275 volumes were lent out for home
                        study in 1905, as compared to 926 in 1901.
                        The exhibition rooms were closed for a month
                        and a-half for structural alterations. Nevertheless,
                        the number of visitors increased from
                        2,000 in 1904 to 8 132 in 1905. Of these latter,
                        2,375 were Europeans, and the remainder
                        Egyptians.</p>

                    <p>Last Saturday the Titania reached Port
                        Said in a damaged condition, having been run
                        into by the S.S. Cromwell in the Canal at
                        kilometre 127. The latter ship was able, in
                        spite of the severe damage to her hull, to proceed
                        to Suez New plates are being placed in
                        tho Titania, and she will probably be able to
                        proceed to Hull early next week.</p>

                        <p>On Sunday Port Said assumed a lively aspect,
                            crowds being in all the main thoroughfares
                            listening to the different bands. Although
                            few, if any, ever contemplated any other answer
                            to the Ultimatum, yet one could not help noting
                            an under current of excitement. Though
                            probably everyone remarked “just what I told
                            you,” there was no doubt a feeling that the
                            attitude.of Turkey was one which might have
                            caused great unrest among the native populace,
                            more especially in the interior. With three
                            warships in the harbour and others within a
                            day or two’s sail, there was no cause for
                            anxiety here. It was noticed, however, that
                            double guards were placed at the gates to the
                            wharves, and that the police were in greater
                            evidence than usual.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Christophen, head of the Civil Medical
                        Department, Sudan Government, in his annual
                        report, say : —</p>
                    <p>The Sudan is not the fever stricken, smallpox
                        ravaged country, into which the Egyptian
                        diseases (Ophthalmie, Bilharzia, and Anchylostoma)
                        are rapidly being introduced, while
                        sleeping sickness is advancing, cholera and
                        plague threatening Port Sudan, and leprosy
                        creeping in from the west What are the facts!
                        There, are five provinces at least which are
                        practically free from the malaria infection—
                        fever cannot originate there—namely, Haifa,
                        Dongola, Berber, Khartoum, and Suakin; and,
                        with the introduction of suitable dwellings and
                        energetic mosquito brigades, other provinces
                        will be freed from malaria. Small-pox shows
                        itself occasionally, bat if the country can be
                        vaccinated throughout, small-pox will disappear.
                        Great advances have been made towards
                        this end daring the last year or two. The
                        carrier of sleeping-sickness has been caught in
                        Sudan territory it is true, but so far not a single
                        case of sleeping-sickness has been imported.
                        Quarantine regulations have been instituted
                        for Port Sudan and for the Sudan generally ;
                        and the arrangements at Haifa have been so
                        far successfal that plague and cholera have been
                        kept out. Egyptian Ophthalmia is decidedly
                        uncommon, and Bilharzia and Anchylostoma,
                        the two principal Egyptian diseases, have not
                        taken hold of the natives to any extent Lastly,
                        the natives are amenable to medical treatment,
                        so that there is little difficulty in carrying out
                        measures for the security of the country against
                        epidemics, so far as active opposition from the
                        people is concerned. The Bahr el Ghazal must be
                        excepted from this general statement,on account
                        of our present want of knowledge of the character
                        of its peoples, and that of the people of the

                        officer in a village meant a general alarm ;
                        everybody sought a hiding-place. Now, things
                        have changed in such a manner that native

                    <head>WHO IS A BEDOUIN?</head>
                    <p>The Government want a satisfactory definition 
                        of a Bedouin for the following reason.
                        Ever since the days of Mehemet Ali, the
                        Bedouins have been exempted from the obligation
                        of military service. For many reasons it
                        would be extremely undesirable to take away
                        From them their privilege in this respect, which
                        they prize very highly. A practical difficulty,
                        however, has arisen in deciding who is and
                        who is not a Bedouin. A census of the Bedouinss
                        was made more than half a century ago, but
                        it was originally very imperfect, and is now
                        of little use, because large numbers of Bedouins
                        and their families have come into Egypt since
                        it was made. Moreover, some of the records
                        of this census appear to have been destroyed.
                        Under these circumstances, it was decided,
                        after some lengthy discussions, to accept the
                        certificates of the Omdehs and Sheikhs on the
                        subject of Bedouin origin. There is, however,
                        now reason to suppose that some of these
                        Omdehs and Sheikhs are Riving certificates to
                        persons who have no right to receive them,
                        and, in fact, are making a somewhat lucrative
                        trade by the delivery of certificates. The
                        natter, wbich is one of some difficulty, is now
                        under consideration.</p>

                        at the Royal United Service Institution
                        last week, said that the War Office recognised
                        the value of the association in improving the
                        work and the morals of the British soldier,
                        and in fitting him for civilian life on leaving
                        the Army. There could be no question as to
                        the superiority of the temperate over the
                        intemperate man. During his tours of inspection
                        he always inquired about ,the temperance of
                        the Army, and was gratified to hear very often
                        the remark, "We don’t drink much here ; we re
                        all right” (hear, hear). This was not good for

                        exist for drinking only, but to enable the men
                        to mess well and cheaply. There were now
                        49,000 total abstainers in the Army, and when
                        they thought of the small beginnings of the
                        Army Temperance Association they would see
                        that great progress had been made (cheers).</p>
                    <p>Lord Methuen, who supported the Duke,
                        said that he thought the total abstainers were
                        inclined to put their case a little too strongly.
                        If they did that, instead of encouraging
                        temperance they ran the risk of driving the
                        soldier from the canteen to bad company and
                        bad beer outside. He had tried total abstinence
                        for three months, and found it good for the
                        eyes.</p>
